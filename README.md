# next steps 

I have the users location and display the location and icon on map load

now I have to record the users location. Ill start off with the location running 
in the foreground and promt the user to track location

Track location so you can be notified if you came into contact with someone with covid

notify others if you get infected 

see where other users are 
    - have they been vacinated 
    - have they been previously inffected 

idintify where the herd immunity may be and the optimal times you should go out to the store or leisurly activity 

Task list 
- add web sockets to the front end app
